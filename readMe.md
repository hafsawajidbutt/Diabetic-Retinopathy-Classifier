# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection  

Model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TDeVDD5sUQ1sJlSt2tDmTmE12fxANQOG/view?usp=sharing

This project is an AI-powered application designed to classify **retinal fundus images**
into different **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity levels**. The model processes the uploaded
images and predicts the severity of DR using deep learning. The frontend is built using
**Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## 📊 Model Architecture
The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with the following architecture:

4 convolutional layers (32, 64, 128, 128 filters) with ReLU activation.
4 max pooling layers (2x2).
A fully connected dense layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation.
A dropout layer (0.5) to prevent overfitting.
A final output layer with 5 neurons and softmax activation for classification.

## 📊 Model Training
The model is trained on the **DRISHTI-GS** dataset, which contains 5000
images of retinal fundus. The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of
70:30. The model is trained using the **ADABoost** with a learning rate of
0.001 and a batch size of 32. The model is trained for 5 epochs with
early stopping. The model achieves a **test accuracy of 0.49** We could get more accuracy but 
due to time constraint we only get this acuracy
